Description: Stick the assay data stored in the GDS file into the
    SE.For this you need a GDS back-end for DelayedArray.  You'll
    basically need to implement 2 classes for this e.g. GDSArraySeed
    and GDSArray.  This is a project on its own and should preferably
    go in a dedicated package (e.g. GDSArray).
