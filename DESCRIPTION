Description: VariantExperiment is a Bioconductor package for saving
    data in VCF/GDS format into RangedSummarizedExperiment object. The
    high-throughput genetic/genomic data are saved in GDSArray
    objects. The annotation data for features/samples are saved in
    DelayedDataFrame format with mono-dimensional GDSArray in each
    column. The on-disk representation of both assay data and
    annotation data achieves on-disk reading and processing and saves
    memory space significantly. The interface of
    RangedSummarizedExperiment data format enables easy and common
    manipulations for high-throughput genetic/genomic data with common
    SummarizedExperiment metaphor in R and Bioconductor.
