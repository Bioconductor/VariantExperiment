### Problem raised from: when we define the coercion method using `setAs("DelayedDataFrame", "DataFrame")` (`DelayedDataFrame` contains `DataFrame` with one additional slot `lazyIndex`), and construct a `VariantExperiment` object by `ve <- VariantExperiment(colData=DelayedDataFrame())`, then the `col(VE)` returns a `DataFrame` instead of a `DelayedDataFrame`. After discussiong this with Herve, there are 3 problems identified: 

1. why would `new("B", x="")` call `as(..., "A", strict=FALSE)` on the incoming slot value?
2. as() not behaving as expected, because a call like this `as(x, "A", strict=FALSE)`, `as()` should detect that `x` extends `A` and just return x. It should not even call the coercion method from Aa to A.
3. you can't see the automatic coercion method until you've used it i.e. `selectMethod("coerce", c("Aa", "A"))` will fail if you've not called `as(new("Aa") "A")` before. All these problems have been around for years. I started to report them in the R bug tracker at some point but stopped after a while because nobody would take care of them. (Herve)

So a workaround this led us to a temporary fix of the above problems, where we explicitly define the coercion method using `setMethod("coerce", c("Aa", "A"))` by adding the `strict` argument for checking (if `!strict && is(from, "A")`) inside the coercion method. But eventually, the checking should be implemented inside `as(..., "A", strict=FALSE)` method, and remove the `strict` argument from the standard coercion method by using `setAs`. 

### 5/10/2018, work around about coercion method with some demo code. 

```{r}
setClass("A", representation(x = "numeric"))
setClass("Aa", contains = "A")
setClass("B", representation(x = "A"))
class(new("B", x = new("Aa"))@x)
## [1] "Aa"
## attr(,"package")
## [1] ".GlobalEnv"
as(new("Aa"), "A", strict=FALSE)
## An object of class "Aa"
## Slot "x":
## numeric(0)
selectMethod("coerce", c("Aa", "A"))
## Method Definition:
## function (from, to = "A", strict = TRUE) 
## if (strict) {
##     class(from) <- "A"
##     from
## } else from
## <bytecode: 0x4328370>

## Signatures:
##         from to 
## target  "Aa" "A"
## defined "Aa" "A"
```

when explicitly define coercion method between Aa and A, the coercion method ignires the "strict" argument. 
```{r}
setAs("Aa", "A", function(from) new("A", x = from@x))
## the standard way to define coercion method (using setAs) does not let you handle the "strict" argument. And when calling new(), it calls as(new("Aa"), "A", strict=FALSE) (problem 1, "new" calls "as"), but the coercion method could only return "A" with strict=TRUE. (problem 2). So we can only define the coercion method using setMethod("coerce", c("Aa", "A")), and add the "strict" argument here. 
class(new("B", x=new("Aa"))@x)
## [1] "A"
## attr(,"package")
## [1] ".GlobalEnv"
as(new("Aa"), "A", strict=FALSE)
## An object of class "A"
## Slot "x":
## numeric(0)
selectMethod("coerce", c("Aa", "A"))  ## "strict" argument ignored. 
## Method Definition:
## function (from, to = "A", strict = TRUE) 
## new("A", x = from@x)
## <bytecode: 0x1f50da8>

## Signatures:
##         from to 
## target  "Aa" "A"
## defined "Aa" "A"
```

work around
```{r}
setMethod("coerce", c("Aa", "A"),
    function(from, to="A", strict=TRUE) {
        if (!strict && is(from, "A"))
            return(from)
        new("A", x=from@x)
    }
)
class(new("B", x = new("Aa"))@x)
## [1] "Aa"
## attr(,"package")
## [1] ".GlobalEnv"
```
